        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Full stack developer with experience building and writing DRY, testable and efficient code.
            I have worked extensively in a distributed team driven projects where i serve as the Technical Team Lead(TTL) and charged with the responsibility of driving the affairs of the team during different sprints.  
            <br /> I am passionate about new technologies, new ideas and new ways of thinking. I find it rewarding to apply well known technologies and analytical methods from tech industries and develop them further to serve business all over the globe.

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p class="text-muted"></p>
                
        I have almost 3 Years experience building and working on enterprise grade applications with Javascript technologies. I'm really passionate about the Javascript language  because it offers me flexibility to develop for a wide range of platform ranging from web, mobile, desktop and more recently machine learning.
        More importantly, i write clean codes that follows guidelines/conventions (airbnb style guide). My codes are driven towards Test Driven Development(TDD) and follow the DRY principle during development. My code quality is awesome and I ensure this is consistent by integrating different Continuous Integrations tools in my projects.     
        I have a high proficiency in the following associated with Javascript frameworks/libraries; MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)  and FRN (Firebase, React, Node) stack. I have also extended more knowledge of Javascript/React to mobile apps using React-Native technology.

        I've been working with React library everyday for the past year and I have built couple of personal and open source projects. 
        My most notable open source projects is the OpenmMrs project. The world's largest Medical Record system to improve health care delivery in resource-constrained environments by coordinating a global community to create and support this software.        
        I have used my experience with React and firbase to built apps for mobile using React-native. 
        I write test driven codes in React using the Jest framework and also experience in using React's most 2 notable state management library; Flux and Redux.

                <p class="text-muted"></p>
                
      I love Nodejs because its fast, scalable and dynamic. More importantly it let me leverage the power of javascript to build server side tools. I have created API with both REST and Graphql. I have worked on different project ranging from simple web app to complex web app that requires a lot of integrations. 
      With Nodejs i am very productive in my daily activity as it allows me merge the front-end and back-end into a single entity makes it very much efficient.      
      I write test driven codes in Node using Mocha. I practice TDD and follow Single Responsiblity Principle during development. I have experience in node Continuous Integrations using Travis.

        OpenMRS is a software platform and a reference application which enables design of a customized medical records system with no programming knowledge (although medical and systems analysis knowledge is required). It is a common platform upon which medical informatics efforts in developing countries can be built. The system is based on a conceptual database structure which is not dependent on the actual types of medical information required to be collected or on particular data collection forms and so can be customized for different uses.
